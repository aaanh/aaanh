I'm a big sucker for system design, backend dev, DevOps, web technologies, and cloud architectures.

At school, I'm an undergraduate student and currently researching ML/AI/XAI services under the guidance of [Professor Liu](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~liu).

Activities on GitHub are on hiatus. Currently interning at Nuance/Microsoft.
